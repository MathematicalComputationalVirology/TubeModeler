These files should be read into MATLAB.
File “Straight_Tube_2D.m” plots the tiling of a straight tube with helicity number nh and periodicity number np.
File “Straight_Tube_3D.m” plots a straight tube with helicity number nh and periodicity number np around a cylinder (a 3D representation of tubes).
Both codes use “IntersectionPoint.m” function with find intersection point between two 2D lines.
File “Twisted_Tube_3D.m” plots one strips of pentamers. In this code theta1 is the bending angle and theta2 is the rotation angle.
This code uses “rotate_pentamer_twisted.m” function with gets the coordinates of a pentagon and plot a pentagon next to it with bending angle theta1 and torsion angle of theta2.

This file should be read into Python.
File “Script_measuring_angles.py” measures the bending and torsion angles between two structures “chain1” and “chain2” that are binding to each other.
